This is an example of an amazing project that you created.The cool picture was taken by Domenico Loia on Upsplash. Open this example to see more information on how to set up your own Projects posts.


# Front Matter

**Categories:** In order for a post to be marked as a Project its category needs to be Projects(Case sensitive).

**Date:** I'd recommend that you set a date earlier any other blog posts. This is to prevent the links in the footer(_Latest Posts_) to be hidden and show less than 4 links - I'm simply hiding the posts if they fall into the _Projects_ category.

**Tag:** This is the text that will be shown in the blog post title. This could be used as a "category" or any other thing that could help you organize your projects.

**Tag Icon:** The Icon shown before the _Tag text_ I'm using [fontawesome.io](http://fontawesome.io/) because they are amazing. Note that you can use the HTML code of the icon straight in this field and all work okay.

**Excerpt:** If you prefer to set up your own excerpt instead of letting Jekyll get the first 160 words from the first paragraph of the post. 
_Note: The maximum number of characters is 160, anything above will be substituted by ..._

**Image:** The image to be used on the card background and the post header. Jekyll will look in the folder _../assets/images/_ for the name specified in this field.
